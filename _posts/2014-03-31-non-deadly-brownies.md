These brownies are soft and silky, without the deadly ingredients of butter, flour, and sugar found in traditional brownies. Avocado is the secret ingredient that makes them so silky and smooth! 

To make the healthy batter, put all the ingredients except the chocolate chips into a high-speed blender and blend until really smooth. Just use as much almond milk as necessary to get everything to blend. Then add the chocolate chips and pulse the blender to evenly mix them. Pour the mixture into a pan lightly coated with coconut oil and bake in the oven for 13-15 minutes at 350 degrees. Be sure not to overcook them or they will lose their silky texture.

- 3 scoops Chocolate Whey Protein Powder
- 1 1/4 Avocado 
- 2 tbsp Cocoa Powder
- 1/2 cup Raisins
- 1/4 cup Peanut Butter
- 1/4-1/2 cup Almond Milk 
- 1 tbsp Coconut Oil
- 1 tsp Stevia
- 1 tsp Vanilla Extract 
- 3 hand fulls of Chocolate Chips 

I think that this batter tastes great as a dip. It could also work as a healthy icing! You can try using other flavors as well, such as orange, mint, or coconut extract instead of the vanilla.
