This is a chocolatey mint version of my [Everything Squares](http://teri-lynn.ca/2014/05/18/everything-squares/) recipe. These healthy brownies are so gooey and tasty that you will surprised it says *healthy* in the recipe title. The only unhealhty ingredient to speak of in this recipe in fact, is the chocolate chips. You could use sugar-free chocolate chips or dark chocolate chips to make them better. Everyone needs a little chocolate every now and then though! 
  
Don't be scared away by the chickpeas, either. I love creating new recipes with chickpeas, because I find they give a nice soft texture to healthy desserts. At first, it is hard to believe that they can be used for sweet recipes, but they do make a great base when you want something that is healthy and satisfying. 

Use this batter for [cookies](http://teri-lynn.ca/2013/11/09/healthy-chocolate-chip-cookies/), [squares](http://teri-lynn.ca/2014/05/18/everything-squares/), or as a [healthy dip](http://teri-lynn.ca/2013/10/19/healthy-chocolate-dip/). Try different flavour variations!

###Recipe

Mix all the ingredients except the chocolate chips in a high speed blender until very smooth. Add in the chocolate chips and stir by hand. Pour the mixture into a pan that is lightly greased with coconut oil, and bake in the oven at 350 for about 13 minutes, depending on your pan size. Do not overcook as you want the squares to be soft. Store in the fridge and enjoy these squares cold or warmed up.
