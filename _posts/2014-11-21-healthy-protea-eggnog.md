I have always loved eggnog, and always got excited for the first spotting of it out on the store shelves. As I got older and wiser nutrition-wise, I realized that my beloved beverage was cringe worthy in terms of ingredients - extremely high calories, fat, and especially sugar. For years I have tried to come up with a healthy alternative, and I have finally done it! This recipe combines two of my other favourite things - tea and protein powder - to make the perfect healthy     *ProTea* eggnog! 

### Ingredients 

Serves 4.

- 4 egg yolks
- 1 scoop vanilla whey protein powder 
- 2 cups almond milk 
- 3 heaping tsp [DAVIDsTEA Eggnog](http://www.davidstea.com/eggnog?&TF=72F0C1DCC0A4&DEID=) (rooibos tea)
- 1/4 tsp cinnamon
- 1/8 tsp nutmeg 
- 1 tsp powdered stevia 

### Recipe 
Measure 3 heaping teaspoons of [DAVIDsTEA Eggnog](http://www.davidstea.com/eggnog?&TF=72F0C1DCC0A4&DEID=) into a large tea ball. and place it in a small saucepan on the stove. Add 1.5 cups of unsweetened almond milk to this pan and heat on medium until just before boiling. Cover the pan and take it off the burner. Let let the tea steep and cool down while you get the other ingredients ready (at least 5 minutes). 

Separate egg yolks from 4 eggs. Place the egg yolks into a small bowl and beat them with 1/2 cup of unsweetened almond milk, stevia, cinnamon, and nutmeg. 

After stirring, take the tea ball out of the saucepan. Very slowly add the egg yolk mixture to the saucepan as you whisk quickly. Put this mixture back on the burner, on low. Keep whisking until you feel it start to thicken. Do not overcook, otherwise the eggs will start to cook too much and you will get chunks (although a blender can fix that up). 

Pour into a jug and place in the fridge. Once your eggnog is cooled, you can add in a scoop of vanilla whey protein powder. The key is to add in the protein powder once your eggnog is cold, otherwise you risk scorching the powder. Mix with a whisk, blender, or shake up in a protein shaker. 

Serve cold, adding ice cubes and a dash of cinnamon or nutmeg if you wish. Of course you can also add a splash of rum if you desire.
