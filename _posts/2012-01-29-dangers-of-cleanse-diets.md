Cleanse diets claim to rid the body of toxins, and help people lose fat, among 
other things. They usually consist of drinking liquid mixtures or herbal 
remedies of various forms for days on end, and giving your body nothing else. 
This means that you will be lacking essential vitamins and minerals, be low on 
calorie intake, as well as lack protein and healthy fats. This will cause 
headaches, dizziness, nausea, and loss of muscle mass. You will feel low on 
energy due to the lack of calories and nutrients. When the body is not fueled 
properly, you will not be able to get nearly as much out of your workouts, and 
you also risk passing out during it. The other risk of not giving your body 
enough calories is that you will be slowing down your metabolism. Since your 
body will not know when to next expect proper meals, your body's protection 
mechanism will kick in, storing what you do ingest as fat. My suggestion is 
that if you want to cleanse your body, eat clean foods! This means eating 
non-processed, non-sugary foods. Stay away from foods that come in a package, 
and eat foods you would find on the outside aisles of a grocery store like 
fresh fruits and vegetables, meat, dairy, and healthy grains.
