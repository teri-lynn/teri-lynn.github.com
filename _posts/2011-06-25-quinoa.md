Quinoa is a great addition to the variety of whole grains that you eat. It is 
highly nutritious, in that it contains all of the essential amino acids and is 
high in protein! It is also a good source of fibre, phosphorus, magnesium, and 
iron. Other benefits of quinoa is that it is gluten-free, and easy to digest. 
It is quick and easy to prepare, and can be used in the same way as pasta 
or rice.
