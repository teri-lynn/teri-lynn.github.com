To save yourself time in the morning, pack your lunch salads for the week ahead of time,
and then store them in the fridge so that you can grab them on your way out. It's a great way to eliminate 
time rushing around in the morning and ensure you have a healthy lunch. Buy a large bin of salad mix (mixed greens, baby spinach, romaine, etc.) and dispense it into reusable containers. Then just throw in your toppings. I recommend seeds, nuts, and chopped vegetables or fruit. 
Below is a list of my favorite combinations.
