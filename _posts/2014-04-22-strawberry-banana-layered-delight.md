This layered protein cake is made similarly to my Banana Double Chocolate Cake. 
Preheat the oven to 335. Put all the cake ingredients into a high speed blender and mix until smooth. Pour into a pan that is lightly greased with coconut oil. Bake for 25-30 minutes.

Blend all the icing ingredients in a blender until smooth, and add as much as you wish to the cake. This will make more than double you need for the actual cake, so halve the recipe if you do not want leftovers. 

Store the cake in the fridge. 

Cake: 

- 2 ripe bananas
- 8 small strawberries 
- 1 cup of oats
- 5 scoops of strawberry protein powder
- 1 cup of plain Greek yogurt
- 1 egg 
- 2 tbsp coconut oil
- 2 tsp stevia 
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 5 twists sea salt

Icing:

- 1 cup cottage cheese
- 3/4 cup frozen mixed berries
- 2 scoops strawberry protein powder
- 1/2 tsp stevia
