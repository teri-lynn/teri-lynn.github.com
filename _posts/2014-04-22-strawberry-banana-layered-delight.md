![Strawberry Banana Layered Delight](/images/strawberry_banana.jpg)

This layered protein cake is made similarly to my [Banana Double Chocolate Protein Cake](http://teri-lynn.ca/2014/04/13/protein-cake/). This is a sweet and summery variation. The burst of strawberries is delightful, and so is the high protein content without the use of sugar! 

Preheat the oven to 335 degrees. Put all the cake ingredients into a high speed blender and mix until smooth. Pour into a pan that is lightly greased with coconut oil. Bake for 25-30 minutes.

Blend all the icing ingredients in a blender until smooth, and add as much as you wish to the cake. 

Store the protein cake in the fridge.
