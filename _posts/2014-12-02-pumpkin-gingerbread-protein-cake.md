Here's a healthy spin on traditional gingerbread cake. You can enjoy the warm spices of the season without having to ruin your healthy eating plans. Bring this cake to your holiday party to surprise your friends and family. They will not believe that something this tasty contains no flour, sugar, questionable ingredients, and is only around 50 calories a serving! 

### Recipe
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Put all the ingredients (except the pumpkin seeds and chocolate chips) into a high speed blender and mix until smooth. Pour into a pan that is lightly greased with coconut oil. Sprinkle chocolate chips and/or pumpkin seeds on top if you wish. 

Place in a large rectangular pan that is lightly greased with coconut oil. Bake for about 25 minutes. Bake longer if you want a firmer cake, and shorter for an even creamier, softer cake. For a softer cake, take it out of the oven when only the edges of the cake are starting to firm and crack, and the middle is still pudding-like.

Store in the fridge. Enjoy this cake cold, room temperature, or heated up.
