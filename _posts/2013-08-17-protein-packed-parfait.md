![Parfait](/images/parfait.jpg)

This delicious and high protein parfait contains an enormous 52 grams of protein and the healthy antioxidants and vitamins found in berries. It is sweet and satisfying, but contains no sugar! This parfait is an amazing way to satisfy cravings, up your fruit intake, and get in extra protein. 

## Recipe
Mix together with a spoon until smooth: 

- 3/4 cup of plain Greek yogurt (18g of protein)
- 1 scoop of vanilla protein powder (35g of protein)
- 1 tsp of vanilla extract
- 1 tsp of stevia 

Add on top:

- a handful of fresh strawberries and blueberries

This serving may be too large for one sitting, depending on your hunger level. You can always save half of it for the next day. This is a great snack to bring to work for an afternoon boost!

You can mix it up by using different flavours of protein powder and adding different fruits on top. I recommend an After Eight guilt-free dessert of chocolate protein powder and peppermint extract...a delicious mint chocolate pudding!
