Rhubarb is one of the best things about summer! The only problem with all the rhubarb recipes out there is that they all contain so much sugar - since rhubarb is so tart. If you want to be able to enjoy your backyard rhubarb this summer without having to worry about all the sugar and fat in rhubarb pie, this recipe is perfect for you! This pie-cake is deliciously high in protein, contains no sugar, and is made with all healthy ingredients. The creamy yogurt in the recipe gives the same feel as a real custard. Banana and stevia are the secret sweeteners.

To make this rhubarb pie-cake, I just slightly altered my recipe for [Strawberry Banana Layered Delight](http://teri-lynn.ca/2014/04/22/strawberry-banana-layered-delight/). 

Preheat the oven to 335 degrees. Put all the pie-cake ingredients except one cup of chopped rhubarb into a high speed blender and mix until smooth. Then add in the cup of chopped rhubarb, or more if you wish, and hand mix to evenly distribute. Pour into a pan that is lightly greased with coconut oil. Bake for about 40 minutes, more or less depending on how gooey you want it to be. 

Store the in the fridge. 

###Pie-Cake Ingredients: 

- 2 ripe bananas
- 4 small strawberries 
- 2 cups chopped rhubarb 
- 1 cup oats
- 5 scoops strawberry protein powder (each scoop is 30 grams; I use [Rivalus Promasil]([http://www.rivalus.net/products/promasil](http://www.rivalus.net/products/promasil)))
- 1 cup plain Greek yogurt
- 1 egg 
- 2 tbsp coconut oil
- 2 tsp stevia 
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 5 twists sea salt
