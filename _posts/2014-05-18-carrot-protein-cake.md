![Carrot Protein Cake](/images/carrot_protein_cake.jpg)

This carrot protein cake is a spin on my [Banana Double Chocolate Protein Cake](http://teri-lynn.ca/2014/04/13/protein-cake/) and my [Strawberry Banana Layered Delight](http://teri-lynn.ca/2014/04/22/strawberry-banana-layered-delight/). This is my healthy version of a carrot cake - it not only has vegetables, but it also has tons of protein! 

Preheat the oven to 335 degrees. Put all the cake ingredients, except the shredded carrots into a high speed blender and mix until smooth. Then add the shredded carrots and hand mix. You could also add chopped walnuts or raisins. Pour into a pan that is lightly greased with coconut oil. Bake for 30-35 minutes.

Blend all the icing ingredients in a blender until smooth, and add as much as you wish to the cake. 

Store the protein cake in the fridge.
