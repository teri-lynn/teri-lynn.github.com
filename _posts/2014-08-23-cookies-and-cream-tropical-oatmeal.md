Here's an oatmeal that you can make ahead of time overnight, or in the microwave when you want it. It makes a great breakfast or snack. The taste is creamy and rich, with a delicious tropical kick. A great way to get in more protein and add some healthy carbs to fuel your body! 

###Ingredients

Serves one.

- 1/3 cup oats
- 1/3 cup unsweetened almond milk
- 1 scoop Cookies N Cream protein powder (Muslce Pharm Combat)
- 2 tbsp plain Greek yogurt (a big spoonful) 
- 1 tbsp chia seeds
- 1-2 tbsp unsweetened shredded coconut
- Half a banana, sliced
- 1 tbsp chocolate chips
- stevia to taste

###Overnight Method 
Stir together all of the ingredients except the banana and chocolate chips. Put this mixture in a covered container in the fridge overnight. Stir again the next day and put in the microwave for about a minute. Then add the banana and chocolate chips. 

###Microwave Method

Put the almond milk and oats into a bowl and heat in the microwave until the oatmeal is cooked to your preference. Then stir in the protein powder, followed by the rest of the ingredients. The chia seeds will not have time to expand like they do in the overnight method so the taste and texture will be a little different. You may also want to use a little less milk since it won't absorb quite as much as it does overnight, although this depends on how runny/thick you like your oatmeal.
