This scrumptious apple cinnamon oatmeal dish smells just like an apple pie baking in the oven, tastes just as good, and is healthy. It is packed with flavor, as well as protein,  and works well for breakfast or snacks.  

Preheat the oven to 275. Slice an apple, very thinly, and spread it on the bottom of a baking dish. Mash up the banana and then add peanut butter, vanilla, cinnamon, salt, stevia, protein powder, and almond milk. Then mix in the oatmeal and pour evenly over the apples. Place in the oven for 20 minutes, or until the mixture starts to firm. 

1 cup quick oats
1/2 cup unsweetened almond milk
2 scoops vanilla whey protein powder  
1/4 cup natural peanut butter
1 very ripe banana, mashed
1 apple, thinly sliced 
1 tsp vanilla extract
1 tsp cinnamon
1/2 tsp stevia 
4 twists sea salt

Use more apples if you want, other fruits such as berries to mix it up.
