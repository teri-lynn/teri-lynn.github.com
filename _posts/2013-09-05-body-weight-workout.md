You don't need equipment to get in an awesome workout. This workout can be done anywhere and in limited space. It works great as an outdoor workout, home workout, or in your hotel room while you are travelling. 

Do this workout with as little rest between exercises as you can, and repeat it 3-5 times, depending on the time you have and your fitness level. Your heart should be pounding as your sweat hits the floor. Have fun!
