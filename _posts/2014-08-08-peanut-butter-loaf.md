![Peanut Butter Loaf](/images/peanut_butter_loaf.jpg)

Bread made with peanut butter! High in protein, no flour, and no sugar! Use this bread for sandwiches, toast, or a little snack with your coffee/tea.  I think it is perfect for a peanut butter and banana sandwich or with a healthy chocolate spread. 

You could also make this loaf into my [Chocolate Peanut Butter Bread](http://teri-lynn.ca/2014/08/12/chocolate-peanut-butter-bread/) instead - just use chocolate protein powder instead of vanilla, add some cocoa powder, and a little bit more stevia. 

You can also try my recipe for [Vegetable Protein Bread](http://teri-lynn.ca/2014/08/01/vegetable-protein-bread/) which makes a great hearty sandwich. 

### Peanut Butter Loaf Recipe

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees and lightly grease a loaf pan with coconut oil. Throw all of these ingredients into a high speed blender and mix until smooth. Pour into the pan and bake for about 45 minutes at 350 degrees. This bread will rise a few centimetres, but not quite as much as regular bread does. Leave a few centimetres at the top of the pan. Store the bread in the fridge. 

- 4 scoops vanilla whey protein powder
- 1 cup liquid egg whites

- 1.5 tsp baking powder

###Chocolate-Almond Spread Recipe 

For the healthy chocolate spread, I made this recipe inspired by Anna Sward of Protein Pow's [Powtella](http://proteinpow.com/2014/06/powtella.html).
  
- 1/2 cup chocolate whey protein powder
- 1/2 cup cocoa powder
- 1/2 cup almond butter
