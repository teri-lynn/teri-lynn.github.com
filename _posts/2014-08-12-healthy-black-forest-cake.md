Here's a Black Forest Cake version of my healthy [Protein Cake](http://teri-lynn.ca/2014/04/13/protein-cake/) recipe! This recipe combines the delicious flavours of cherries, coconut, and chocolate for a delectable treat that is actually good for you.  
 
###Recipe

Preheat the oven to 350. Put all the ingredients (except the second cup of cherries, the shredded coconut, and the chocolate chips) into a high speed blender and mix until smooth. Add in about a cup or more of fresh or frozen cherries and pulse the blender a couple times to chop them. Then add as many chocolate chips as you want, and 1/2 cup or more of shredded coconut and hand mix to distribute. Pour into a pan that is lightly greased with coconut oil. Bake for about 30-35 minutes at 350 degrees, more or less, depending on how gooey you want the protein cake. A knife will come out slightly gooey when inserted into the cake. Store in the fridge once cooled. 

- 2 ripe bananas
- 1 cup cherries + 1 more cup left unblended 
- 1 cup of oats
- 3 scoops of chocolate whey protein powder
- 1 cup of plain Greek yogurt
- 1 egg 
- 2-3 tbsp natural peanut butter
- 1/4-1/2 cup cocoa powder 
- 1 tbsp coconut oil
- 1-2 tsp powdered stevia or 20 liquid stevia drops 
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1.5 teaspoons baking soda
- 5 twists sea salt
- 1/2 - 1 cup chocolate chips 
- 1/2 - 1 cup unsweetened shredded coconut 

The top layer is the spread that is used in my recipe for [Peanut Butter Loaf](http://teri-lynn.ca/2014/08/08/peanut-butter-loaf/).
