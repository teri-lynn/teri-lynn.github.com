Post-workout snacks are important because after a hard workout, the body needs 
glycogen and amino acids to refuel and repair muscle. Having a proper snack 
within about 30 minutes of a workout will actually help the body repair faster 
and build muscle more efficiently. The best post-workout snack will consist of 
mostly carbohydrates and some protein (4 or 3 to 1 ratio). Some simple snacks 
include: 100% juice, chocolate milk, yogurt, fruit, peanut/almond butter with 
whole grains, and smoothies. Be sure to drink lots of water after your workout 
as well to replace the fluids lost through sweat. Try to eat whole foods, 
rather than bars or protein powder. This article has great suggestions for 
snacks you can bring with you to the gym.
