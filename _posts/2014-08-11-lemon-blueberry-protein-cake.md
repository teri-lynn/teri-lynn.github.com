This fresh and summery cake is perfect for a healthy dessert, to go along with your afternoon tea, or as a pre or post workout snack. It has tons of protein and no sugar.  It's another version of my basic [Protein Cake](http://teri-lynn.ca/2014/04/13/protein-cake/) recipe. 


###Recipe

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees and lightly grease a brownie pan with coconut oil. Blend all the ingredients except the blueberries in a high speed blender until smooth. Mix in the blueberries by hand and then pour into the pan and bake for 30-35 minutes at 350 degrees. The cake will be creamier if you cook it for a shorter time; overcooking can dry it out. Use a knife to check with the pie is ready. The knife will come out slightly gooey when ready, if you want creamier squares. Store the pie in the fridge. 

- 2 - 3 ripe bananas
- 1/2 - 3/4 cup lemon juice 
- 1 cup oats
- 3 scoops vanilla whey protein powder
- 1 cup plain Greek yogurt
- 1 egg 
- 2 tablespoons coconut oil
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1.5 teaspoon baking soda
- 5 twists sea salt
- stevia to taste 
- 2 cups or more fresh or frozen blueberries
