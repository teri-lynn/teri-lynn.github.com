Here's a variation of my [matcha balls recipe](http://teri-lynn.ca/2014/05/03/matcha-balls/). I used Cookies N Cream flavored protein powder which makes this healthy snack taste like cookie dough! 

###Ingredients

- 3 scoops [MusclePharm Combat Cookies N Cream](http://halfwhey.com/products/6) protein powder 
- 1/2 cup oatmeal
- 1/2 cup almond milk 
- 1/4 cup coconut flour
- 1/4 cup unsweetened dried shredded coconut
- 2 tbsp hemp seed hearts
- 1/2 tsp stevia powder or 15 liquid stevia drops 
- hand-full chocolate chips

###Recipe Instructions 

Mix together all the ingredients except the almond milk. Once everything is mixed, add the almond milk to bind. The mixture will be sticky but not runny. Keep your hands damp with water as you roll into balls. Store them in the fridge for a quick snack. 

###Tips
You can change the flavour of the recipe by using different flavours of protein powder and adding different seeds, nuts, or dried fruit. Chia seeds and raisins work great! The possibilities are endless, so you won't get bored of this addicting recipe!
