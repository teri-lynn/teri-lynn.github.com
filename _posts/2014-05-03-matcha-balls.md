This is a simple recipe to make but it's impressive looking and tasting! You only need a few ingredients and a few minutes. 

Matcha green tea provides impressive health benefits due to its high level of anti-oxidants. One cup of matcha tea is equivalent in health benefits to about ten cups of regular green tea. The great part about this snack is that you also get the added benefit of protein! 

###Ingredients

- 2 scoops (41g each) vanilla whey protein powder
- 1/4 cup coconut flour
- 1/4 cup dry oatmeal 
- 1 1/2 tsp matcha green tea powder
- 1/2 tsp stevia 
- almond milk as needed to bind
- melted chocolate 

###Recipe Instructions 

Hand mix the first 5 ingredients together in a bowl, and then just add the almond milk to the mixture to bind it. It will be sticky, but you do not want it too runny. You can add more coconut flour if you accidentally use too much milk. Roll into balls. Dampen your hands with water so that the mixture rolls more easily. Drizzle chocolate over top, dunk into chocolate, or just add chocolate chips to the mixture. Place in the freezer to harden the chocolate or to store for later. 

These make a great snack while you are on the go, or a beautiful addition to tea time.
