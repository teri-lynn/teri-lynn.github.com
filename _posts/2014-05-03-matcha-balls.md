![Strawberry Banana Layered Delight](/images/strawberry_banana.jpg)

This layered protein cake is made similarly to my [Banana Double Chocolate Cake](http://teri-lynn.ca/2014/04/13/protein-cake/). This is a sweet and summery variation. The burst of strawberries is delightful, and so is the high protein content without the use of sugar! 

Preheat the oven to 335. Put all the cake ingredients into a high speed blender and mix until smooth. Pour into a pan that is lightly greased with coconut oil. Bake for 25-30 minutes.

Blend all the icing ingredients in a blender until smooth, and add as much as you wish to the cake. This will make more than double you need for the actual cake, so halve the recipe if you do not want leftovers. 

Store the cake in the fridge. 

Cake: 

- 2 ripe bananas
- 8 small strawberries 
- 1 cup oats
- 5 scoops strawberry protein powder (each scoop is 30 grams)

- 2 tsp stevia 
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 5 twists sea salt

Icing:

- 1 cup cottage cheese
- 3/4 cup frozen mixed berries

- 1/2 tsp stevia
