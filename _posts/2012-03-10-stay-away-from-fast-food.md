Take a look at the nutritional value charts (well, lack of nutritional value) 
of popular restaurants and fast food chains, and you will be shocked. I always 
say things in moderation are okay, and that it's okay to treat yourself every 
so often, but many of the things on these menus are scary enough to never eat! 
If you are going to eat out, it's a good idea to familiarize yourself with the 
items on the menus to make better informed decisions when deciding where to go 
and what to eat there. 

### Scary Facts

#### The Keg

There are about 1000 calories and 60 grams of fat in both The Keg's garlic 
bread and bruchetta. The Keg's fries have less fat in them than their roasted 
garlic mashed potatoes.

#### Subway

One Subway footlong can easily add up to 1000 calories and 50 grams of fat 
depending on the bread you choose, the meat, and the sauces. I recommend just 
sticking to their 6g of fat or less section.
