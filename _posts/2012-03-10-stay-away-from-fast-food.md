Take a look at the nutritional value charts (well, lack of nutritional value) 
of popular restaurants and fast food chains, and you will be shocked. I always 
say things in moderation are okay, and that it's okay to treat yourself every 
so often, but many of the things on these menus are scary enough to never eat! 
If you are going to eat out, it's a good idea to familiarize yourself with the 
items on the menus to make better informed decisions when deciding where to go 
and what to eat there. 

## Scary Facts

- There are about 1000 calories and 60 grams of fat in both 
  [The Keg](http://www.kegsteakhouse.com/en/nutritional-charts/starters-soup/)'s 
  garlic bread and bruchetta. The Keg's fries have less fat in them than their 
  roasted garlic mashed potatoes.
- [East Side Mario](http://www.eastsidemarios.com/pdfs/EastSideMariosNutritionGuide.pdf)'s 
  chicken garden salad has 26 grams of fat and their caesar 
  salads have around 50 grams of fat.
- [Tim Horton](http://www.timhortons.com/ca/pdf/nutrition-guide-can.pdf)'s muffins have more calories and fat than their donuts.
- A grande vanilla latte from [Starbucks](http://www.starbucks.com/menu) has
  250 calories. Their frappuccinos have around 400 calories.
- One [Subway](http://www.subway.com/nutrition/nutritionlist.ASPX?COUNTRYCODE=CAN&LANGUAGECODE=ENG&id=sandwich) 
  footlong can easily add up to 1000 calories and 50 grams of fat depending on 
  the bread you choose, the meat, and the sauces. I recommend just sticking to 
  their 6g of fat or less section.
- [Kelsey](http://www.kelseys.ca/nutrition.php)'s baked four cheese tortellini 
  has 84 grams of fat.
