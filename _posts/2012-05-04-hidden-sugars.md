When we consume sugar, blood sugar levels are raised quickly, spiking blood 
sugar as well as insulin levels. Glucose in our blood that does not get used up 
by our body gets stored as fat. Simple sugars are found in processed foods, such
as white breads and pastas, cereals, condiments, candy, drinks, packaged meals, 
sauces, and so on. This is why it is so important to eat whole, fresh foods, and 
not items found in packages. Sugar can be hidden anywhere, and the only way 
ensure your meals are healthy and sugar-free is to prepare them yourself using 
wholesome ingredients. 

Too much sugar increases the risk of:

  - weight gain
  - heart disease
  - diabetes
  - headaches
  - mood swings
  - dental decay
