Here's a delicious secret for you. The batter for my [Everything Squares](http://teri-lynn.ca/2014/05/18/everything-squares/) tastes amazing raw! It's very similar to the recipe for my [Healthy Chocolate Dip](http://teri-lynn.ca/2013/10/19/healthy-chocolate-dip/). You can make it in all different kinds of flavours, such as mint chocolate like I did for my [Double Chocolate Mint Healthy Brownies](http://teri-lynn.ca/2014/08/24/double-chocolate-mint-healthy-brownies/) or classic chocolate chip like I did for my [Healthy Chocolate Chip Cookies](http://teri-lynn.ca/2013/11/09/healthy-chocolate-chip-cookies/). As you can see, this chickpea batter can be eaten raw with a spoon, or baked into brownies or cookies. I also like to use it as a healthy icing when layering some of my other healthy recipes. You can also pop some of the dough into the microwave if you would like a quick soft cookie. 

Here is my oatmeal raisin flavoured cookie dough. The extra touch of cinnamon really makes this recipe even more comforting. 

###Recipe
Mix all the ingredients (except the oatmeal and second portion raisins) together in a high speed blender until very smooth. Only use as much almond milk as you need for the blender to run, in order to keep the dough thick. When smooth, add in the oatmeal and raisins and mix by hand. Store in the fridge and enjoy this cookie dough on it's own, as a dip, cooked into brownies/squares, cooked into cookies, as an icing, or heated up in the microwave.

- 3 scoops [vanilla whey protein powder](http://halfwhey.com/) (or more)
