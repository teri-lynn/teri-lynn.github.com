Check out this [infographic](http://mashable.com/2011/05/09/sitting-down-infographic/) 
which discusses the dangers of prolonged sitting. Many jobs involve sitting all 
day, and for people who have these types of jobs, it is very important for them 
to interrupt these long hours of sitting, even if it is for just a few minutes. 
You will be more productive with your work if you take a few minutes each hour 
to move around. Get up and stretch, go for a brisk walk, walk up and down some 
stairs, do a few push ups; anything to interrupt your day full of sitting. Then 
when you are home at night, try to limit how much you are sitting there. Put 
exercise in your day where ever you can. Hold a plank during commercial breaks 
as you watch TV, walk to work, take the stairs instead of the elevator, and 
park at the back of the parking lot. Every exercise you do throughout your 
day will add up!
