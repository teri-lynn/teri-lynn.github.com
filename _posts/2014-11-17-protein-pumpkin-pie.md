Here's my healthy alternative to regular pumpkin pie that you can enjoy during the holidays or whenever you are feeling like a pumpkin treat. This protein packed pie gives you the benefits of vitamin A without all the sugar, flour, fat, and high calories of a traditional pumpkin pie. Here's how you can keep your traditions without having to feel guilty! This pie is so creamy and flavourful that you will forget that it's actually healthy! 

If you love chocolate and want a spin on traditional pumpkin pie, try my chocolate version, [Bud's Chocolate Chunky Protein Pie](http://teri-lynn.ca/2014/11/12/bud's-chocolate-chunky-pumpkin-pie/).

### Recipe
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Put all the ingredients (except the pumpkin seeds and chocolate chips) into a high speed blender and mix until smooth. Pour into a pan that is lightly greased with coconut oil. Add chocolate chips and/or pumpkin seeds to the mixture if you wish (my favourite is adding a few chocolate chips to the batter before cooking). Bake for about 25 minutes. Bake longer if you want a firmer pie, and shorter for an even creamier, softer pie. For a softer pie, take out it out of the oven when only the edges of the cake are starting to firm and crack, and the middle is still pudding-like.

Store in the fridge. Enjoy this pie cold, room temperature, or heated up. 

You can top this pie with an icing made of Greek yogurt, vanilla or chocolate protein powder, pumpkin puree, cinnamon, nutmeg, and stevia if you wish.
