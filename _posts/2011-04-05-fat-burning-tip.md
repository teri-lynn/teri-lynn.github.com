Many people believe that in order to burn fat, they have to do tons of cardio. 
The key to burning fat is actually strength training! The more muscle you have 
on your body, the more your metabolism will increase, which will help you burn 
calories faster. In fact, having just one extra pound of muscle on your body 
will help you burn an additional 30-80 calories each day! Doing a strength 
training workout will burn about as many calories as a cardio workout, however 
without the muscle, you will not be able to burn those extra calories 
afterwards!
