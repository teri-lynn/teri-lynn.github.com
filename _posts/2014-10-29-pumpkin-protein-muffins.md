I love pumpkin, whether it is fall or even summer! Here's another shape and flavour to make my [Everything Squares](http://teri-lynn.ca/2014/05/18/everything-squares/) in. It's a similar recipe but with a totally different result. 

Mix everything together in a high speed blender until very smooth. You may need to use a little more almond milk, depending on how much pumpkin puree you use. 

Once the batter is very smooth, add in the chocolate chips and stir by hand. You can also add in pumpkin seeds, nuts, or raisins if you wish; be creative! 

Pour the mixture into a pan that is lightly greased with coconut oil. You can use mini muffin trays, large muffin trays, a brownie-type pan, or a cake or pie pan. Garnish the top with roasted pumpkin seeds and chocolate chips. Bake in the oven at 350 degrees for about 15 minutes. The cooking time will vary depending on the size of pan you use. Do not overcook as you want the muffins to be soft. 

Store in the fridge and enjoy these healthy muffins cold or warmed up.
