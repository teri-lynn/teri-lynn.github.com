How many calories do you burn throughout your day? If you want to lose weight, 
you need to burn off slightly more calories each day than you take in.

You can use a [BMR calculator](http://www.bmi-calculator.net/bmr-calculator/) 
to calculate your basal metabolic rate, which is the amount of energy 
(calories) you use while at rest just to sustain basic functioning of the 
body's organs. Basically, if you were to lay in bed all day, this would be the 
number of calories you would need to take in. The more active you are, the more 
calories you will need. This calculator will also show you how many calories 
you need for your activity level. Be sure to check out the 
[Harris Benedict Equation](http://www.bmi-calculator.net/bmr-calculator/harris-benedict-equation/) 
once you have your BMI so that you can determine your calorie intake for your 
activity level. 

Using the [Calories Burned Chart](http://www.dailycute.net/images/content/486.jpg), 
find your activity or sport and look under your approximate weight column to 
see how many calories you burn for one hour of participation.

Using the [Calories Burned Calculator](http://www.healthstatus.com/calculate/cbc),
put in your weight and the number of minutes for each activity, and this site 
will help you estimate your total calories burned.
