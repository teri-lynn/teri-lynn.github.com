Every year, witch finger shortbread cookies are always part of my family's Halloween. Everyone looks forward to the unique tradition. This year, I decided to try making my own healthier version of these beloved cookies. I'm happy with how they turned out! 

###Recipe

First mix the spinach and almond milk in a high speed blender until it is well blended. You should have a very bright green milk when done. You can also use green food colouring if you don't want to use spinach. 

Next, mix by hand the other ingredients (except the chocolate and almonds) until well blended, and then mix in the green milk. 

Lightly grease a cookie pan with coconut oil. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. 

Shape the dough into creepy witch fingers. Use a toothpick to make crease lines on the fingers. When you are happy with the shapes, place in the oven for about 10 minutes. The cookies should be starting to firm up on the outsides (so that they keep their shape) but still a bit soft on the inside.  

While the cookies are in the oven, melt the chocolate with the almond milk in the microwave. Be careful not to burn the chocolate. It should only take 30 seconds to melt. 

Find nicely shaped slivered almonds to use for the fingernails. Dip them into the melted chocolate and place at the end of the fingers. Let them set in place. Place the pan in the fridge or freezer for quicker setting. 

Serve on their own or with a [Healthy Chocolate Dip](http://teri-lynn.ca/2013/10/19/healthy-chocolate-dip/).
