Here's a healthy key lime pie with a delicious creamy texture that's bursting with the freshness of lime. A wonderful summer treat without the guilt! You can also try my [Strawberry Banana](http://teri-lynn.ca/2014/04/22/strawberry-banana-layered-delight/) version or [Rhubarb Pie-Cake](http://teri-lynn.ca/2014/06/23/rhubarb-pie-cake/) for other summery options. 

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees and lightly grease a pie pan with coconut oil. 

###Crust:

Blend the crust ingredients in a high speed blender. Use more almond milk if necessary. Press the crust into the pie pan with your hands. Bake for about 10 minutes at 350 degrees. Turn down the oven to 310 degrees when baking the pie filling. 

- 1/2 cup oats
- 1/2 cup blanched slivered almonds
- 1 scoop vanilla whey protein powder 
- 3 tablespoons natural peanut butter or almond butter
- 3 tablespoons unsweetened almond milk
- 3 twists sea salt
- stevia to taste
- 1/4 unsweetened shredded coconut (optional; work into batter with your hands or as you press the crust into pan)

###Pie Filling: 

Blend all the pie ingredients in a high speed blender until smooth. Then pour over the crust in the pie pan and bake for 40-50 minutes at 350 degrees. The pie will be creamier if you cook it for a shorter time; overcooking can dry it out. Use the toothpick method to check when the pie is ready. 

- 2 ripe bananas
- juice of 3 limes 
- shredded rinds of 2 limes  
- 1 cup oats
- 3 scoops vanilla whey protein powder
- 1 cup plain Greek yogurt
- 1 egg 
- 2 tbsp coconut oil
- stevia to taste 
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1.5 teaspoon baking soda
- 5 twists sea salt

###Pie Topping:

Mix together about 3/4 cup of plain Greek yogurt with 1 scoop of vanilla whey protein powder. Add stevia to sweeten, and the juice of about half a lime. Pour as much as you wish over the pie and decorate with slices of lime. 

Store the pie in the fridge.
