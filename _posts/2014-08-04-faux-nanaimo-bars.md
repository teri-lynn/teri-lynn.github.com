This is a healthier spin on Nanaimo bars, replacing the traditional butter with sources of healthy fats like almond butter, avocado, and coconut oil. Fruits are also used instead of sugar. Surprisingly, these bars also have some hidden spinach in the middle layer! As a bonus, there's no baking required for these. 

###Bottom Layer

Put everything except the last three ingredients (shredded coconut, oatmeal, and walnuts) into a high speed blender. Blend until smooth. Pulse in the last three ingredients so that they are still a little chunky. Press into a brownie pan that is lightly coated with coconut oil. Set aside while you make the middle layer. 

- 2 tbsp coconut oil
- 1/2 cup cocoa powder
- 1/2 cup chocolate protein powder
- 1/2 cup almond butter
- 1/2 cup raisins 
- 10 drops liquid vanilla stevia
- 1 tbsp almond milk, or more if necessary for blending 
- 1 tbsp honey
- 8 twists sea salt
- 1/4- 1/2 cup shredded coconut
- 1/4 cup oatmeal
- 1/4-1/2 cup walnuts 

###Middle Layer

Blend everything at once in the blender until smooth. Spoon over the bottom layer and place in the freezer for about an hour. 

- 1 avocado
- 1/4 cup Greek yogurt
- 2 scoops vanilla protein powder
- 1 banana 
- 10 drops liquid vanilla stevia
- 1/2 tsp mint extract, or to taste 
- 2 hand-fulls spinach (for colour)

###Top Layer

Melt about 1 cup of dark chocolate chips and pour over the middle layer. Add a few drops of mint extract to the melted chocolate for an extra minty flavour. 

You can store the bars in the fridge or freezer and cut into squares to eat. 

The middle layer is a little runnier than regular Nanaimo bars, although it tastes delicious. I believe this layer could also be made using chickpeas, vanilla protein powder, nut butter, raisins, mint extract, and spinach for colour, similarly to my [Healthy Chocolate Dip](http://teri-lynn.ca/2013/10/19/healthy-chocolate-dip/), adding less almond milk to make it thicker.
