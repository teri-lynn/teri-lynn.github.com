This delicious dip is perfect for dipping fruit into, or even just enjoying a spoonful of! After you taste it, you will be shocked that it's made from healthy ingredients and is high in protein! 

To make the dip, throw all the ingredients into a high-speed blender and blend until really smooth. I don't usually measure the ingredients exactly. These numbers are estimates, so feel free to play around with the amounts of each. 

- 5 scoops [chocolate protein powder](http://halfwhey.com/)
- one 19 oz can of chickpeas (drained and rinsed)
- 1 cup almond milk
- 1 cup raisins
- 1 tsp stevia powder
- 2 tbsp cocoa powder
- 1/4 cup peanut butter 
- 2 tbsp coconut oil
- 2 tsp vanilla extract (or mint or orange) 
- 1/3 cup oatmeal
- 4 twists of sea salt 

Scoop the dip into two containers and place one in the freezer to enjoy later, and one for the fridge to enjoy once cold. 

You can also use the dip as a muffin or cake batter. Add 1 tsp of baking powder and bake the muffins in the oven at 350 degrees for around 10 minutes. The less time you leave them in, the more gooey they will be. 

Have fun experimenting with different ways to make and eat the dip!
