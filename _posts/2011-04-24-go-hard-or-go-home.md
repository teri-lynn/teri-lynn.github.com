People often ask me, why am I not seeing the results I want when I workout 
all the time? One common thing I usually discover is that the person just 
isn't pushing it enough. Some people come to the gym and do the same thing 
every workout; the same number of repetitions with the same weights. This is 
not going to help you improve, or even maintain!

If you want to see results, you need to improve every single time you workout. 
This means either doing more repetitions (usually just one), or increasing your 
weights (by 2.5 pounds). These small improvements each workout are what get you 
the larger results with time. I cannot stress enough how important it is to 
push yourself!

I sometimes tell people, if you think that was the last rep you could do, 
you probably still have three more in you! Most people will stop as soon as 
they start to really feel the burn, but you need to push through this. The last 
three reps you do should feel extremely difficult. You should be barely pushing 
out the last one! If you think you are done, try one more. If you literally 
can't do it, then you are done, and only then. Every set should be this way. 
If you can't do the same number of repetitions as you did the last set, you did 
not rest long enough between sets.

Make sure you always track you progress. If you aren't writing anything down, 
how will you know what you are aiming for next workout?
