Stress is a natural part of our everyday lives, but when we become too stressed 
and do not manage it properly it affects our health very negatively. Chronic 
stress leads to many illnesses and health problems such as depression, high 
blood pressure, heart disease, obesity, sleep problems, skin conditions, 
irritability, and addiction. One of the best ways to manage your stress is 
through exercise! Exercise releases endorphins which help relieve stress and 
make you feel good! [Health Canada](http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/hl-vs/iyh-vsv/life-vie/stress-eng.php) 
also has other great suggestions for managing your stress.
