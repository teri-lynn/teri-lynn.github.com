Smoothies can make an excellent snack or addition to a healthy meal! They are 
easy and quick to make, and a great way to add to your fruit intake for the 
day! Just keep fruits stocked in your freezer and throw them in the blender 
any time you want a tasty, refreshing smoothie! Then all you need to do is add 
some yogurt and some juice or milk, and you are set! Be creative; you can't go 
wrong! Just make sure that you use a good quality juice (one made with real 
fruit juices and no added sugar), or a low fat milk (skim or 1%). To add some 
extra nutritional value, keep some spinach frozen and throw in a handful. 
Keeping frozen banana chunks on hand also works great!
