Smoothies can make an excellent snack or addition to a healthy meal! They are 
easy and quick to make, and a great way to add to your fruit intake for the 
day. Just keep fruits stocked in your freezer and throw them in the blender 
any time you want a tasty, refreshing smoothie. Then all you need to do is add 
some Greek yogurt and some juice or milk, and you are set. Be creative; you can't 
go wrong! Just make sure that you use a good quality juice (one made with real 
fruit juices and no added sugar), or a low fat milk (skim or 1%). To add some 
extra nutritional value, keep some spinach frozen and throw in a handful. 
Ground flax seed is another way to add value to your smoothie because of the addition 
of Omega-3s. For a complete breakfast smoothie, adding in some good quality protien 
isolate powder can be helpful. Keeping frozen banana chunks on hand also works great! 
Try different combinations to find what you like, and to mix it up! 

Here's what to throw in the blender:
- Spinach
- Plain Greek yogurt
- Ground flax seed
- Fruit (berries, bananas, tropical fruit, etc.)
- Ice cubes/water/100% juice/milk (regular, soy, almond, etc.)
- Protein isolate powder
