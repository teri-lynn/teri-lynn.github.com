This delicious smoothie tastes like a Terry's Chocolate Orange, except instead of being high in sugar and calories, it's high in protein and nutrients! It makes for a satisfying breakfast, snack, or dessert. Use it to conquer cravings and up your protein and vegetable intake. 

The recipe can be done in a few different ways. It also tastes great with a banana added in. The measurements do not need to be exact, you can estimate. 

##  Ingredients 
- 2 handfuls of spinach
- 3 big spoonfuls of plain Greek yogurt
- 3-4 scoops of chocolate protein powder
- 1-2 mandarins/celmintines/oranges 
- 8-10 strawberries
