Being fit does not mean pertaining to one type of body. We are all made 
differently, and the key is to be the best that you can be. Athletes of various 
sports will develop their bodies and muscles differently, because of what is 
required for their specific sport skills. Click on the images

to see Olympians of a range of sports. Each athlete has amazing fitness, 
however they each have very differently developed bodies. Use this as your 
inspiration to achieve excellence in your body, and be proud of who you are, 
your abilities, and what your body can do for you!
