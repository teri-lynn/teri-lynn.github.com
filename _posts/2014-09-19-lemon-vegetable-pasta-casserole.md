This tasty casserole is packed with healthy vegetables that are drizzled in a lemon and olive oil garlic sauce with a three cheese combo that adds extra savoury comfort. It's quick and easy to make, and does not have to be exact.

I never measure for this one, and throw in a combination of these vegetables in quantities I wish. The key is to make sure you use enough tomatoes (at least 2 in each dish) so that the pasta will cook in their juice. You can add as much or as little pasta as you like, and same with the cheese. I use whole wheat pasta or in this case, a red lentil bean pasta. 

### Ingredients 
This makes about two casserole dishes worth. 

- 1/2 a cauliflower head, chopped
- 4-5 fresh tomatoes, chopped
- 2 cups broccoli, chopped
- 2 cups uncooked pasta noodles 
- 1/2 cup olive oil
- 1/2 cup lemon juice
- 1 tbsp Italian spice
- 2 tbsp garlic
- 10 twists pepper
- 5 twists sea salt
- feta cheese
- Parmesan cheese
- Jalape√±o Havarti cheese 


### Recipe 

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. 

Chop the vegetables and add them into the casserole dishes as you go. Stir them together and add in the uncooked pasta noodles. 

In a separate bowl, mix together the lemon juice, olive oil, pepper, salt, Italian spice, and garlic. Drizzle this over the pasta and vegetables and then stir. 

Add in as much Parmesan and feta cheese as you wish and mix in with the pasta and vegetables. Shred some Havarti over the top of the mixture. 

Put a lid on each casserole dish and cook in the oven for about 30-45 minutes at 400 degrees. There will be juice left at the bottom even when it is done; just ensure that the pasta noodles are cooked before removing from the oven.
