![Everything Squares](/images/everything_squares.jpg)

This recipe is very similar to my recipe for [Healthy Chocolate Chip Cookies](http://teri-lynn.ca/2013/11/09/healthy-chocolate-chip-cookies/). The "everything" is all the extra ingredients mixed into the basic recipe. 

Mix the basic batter together in a high speed blender until very smooth. Just use as much almond milk as you need to for it to mix well. Then, add in any "everything" ingredients that you wish, and stir by hand. Pour the mixture into a pan that is lightly greased with coconut oil, and bake in the oven at 350 for about 13 minutes. Do not overcook as you want the squares to be soft. Store in the fridge and enjoy these squares cold or warmed up. 

###Basic Batter 
- 3 scoops Vanilla Protein Powder
- One 19 oz can of Chickpeas (drained and rinsed)
- 3/4 cup Almond Milk
- 1/2 cup Raisins
- 1/4 cup Peanut Butter
- 1 tbsp Coconut Oil 
- 1.5 tsp Baking Powder
- 2 tsp Vanilla Extract
- 1 tsp Stevia 
- 4 twists Sea Salt

###"Everything" Ingredients: 
- Oatmeal
- Chia Seeds
- Chocolate Chips
- Hemp Seeds
- Slivered Almonds (or any nuts)
- Raisins (or other dried fruits)
- Unsweetened Shredded Coconut
