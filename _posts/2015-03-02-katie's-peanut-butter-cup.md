I created this recipe for my little sister, Katie, and her love for peanut butter cups!

These peanut butter cups make an irresistible treat that contains healthy fat and lots of protein. It's great for people who are bulking and need to get in extra calories. It also works really well as a convenient snack to bring on long hikes or trips. Or, if you just want a healthier alternative to a traditional peanut butter cup, you can make these treats in any size you want. 

I never measure ingredients when I make these, so the below list contains estimates. You can't really go wrong with this recipe, and you can alter it to your preference as you go. The base filling can be used in many different ways, as shown by the picture. 

###Recipe

Microwave the chocolate chips with a splash of milk, stirring very often so that you do not burn the chocolate. You want the chocolate to be a pliable texture so that you can use your hands to mould it to a silicone container. Once you have moulded the chocolate to the bottom and sides of the container you chose, put it in the freezer to set while you make the peanut butter filling. Save some of the chocolate for the top of the peanut butter cup. 

In a large bowl, mix together the peanut butter and chocolate protein powder. You can melt the peanut butter in the microwave if you wish, which will make it easier to mix. You can add more or less protein powder to get the ratio you prefer. The mixture will be too crumbly if you add too much protein powder. To keep the texture soft, add in the protein powder slowly. Next, add in honey to your taste preference. 

Squish the filing into the chocolate cup, and then add more chocolate to make the top. Sprinkle the top with sea salt and/or hemp seed hearts, and place back in the freezer to set. Once the cups have set, you can peel off the silicone cup. 

This recipe makes approximately 4 large cups. 

Store the peanut butter cups in the freezer or fridge.
