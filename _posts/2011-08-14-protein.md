Protein helps to build and repair body tissues (muscles, tendons, and 
ligaments) and also transports fluids, creates hormones and enzymes, as well 
as helps with immune responses. It is not used as fuel during exercise unless 
an inadequate amount of carbohydrates are consumed. Protein is made of aminio 
acids. There are nine essential amino acids, and where animal protein (meat, 
eggs, fish, or dairy) contains all nine, making it a complete protein, protein 
from other sources such as nuts, seeds, beans, and whole grains is incomplete 
because it must be combined with other foods in order to be complete. 

There are 4 calories per gram of protein. 

The percent of your daily total calories that come from protein should range 
between 10% to 35%. Another way to look at it is intaking 0.8 grams of protein 
per kilogram of your body weight. Athletes however should increase this to 1.2 
to 1.7 grams. 

Athletes need more protein because they generally have more lean body mass, 
which requires more protein. Athletes may also lose a small amount of protein 
in their urine. They also burn a small amount of protein during workouts and 
will require a little more protein in order to recover from muscle damage.

explains how to combine incomplete proteins together to make complete proteins.
