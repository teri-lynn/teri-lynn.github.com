Protein helps to build and repair body tissues (muscles, tendons, and 
ligaments) and also transports fluids, creates hormones and enzymes, as well 
as helps with immune responses. It is not used as fuel during exercise unless 
an inadequate amount of carbohydrates are consumed. Protein is made of aminio 
acids. There are 4 calories per gram of protein. 

Some high protein foods include: meat, eggs, milk, Greek yogurt, nuts, seeds, cheese, beans, tofu, and fish. 

You should eat a portion of protien (size of your palm) with each meal. 
Another way to look at it is intaking about 0.8 grams of protein 
per kilogram of your body weight. However, this is a minimum and athletes and people 
who exercise should increase this to 1.4 to 2.0 grams per kilogram of body weight. 

Athletes need more protein because they generally have more lean body mass, 
which requires more protein. Athletes may also lose a small amount of protein 
in their urine. They also burn a small amount of protein during workouts and 
will require a little more protein in order to recover from muscle damage.
