Pictured above is my healthy Banana Double Chocolate Cake layered with my Vanilla Cinnamon version. Between the layers is homemade peanut butter. All the ingredients are healthy, but after trying this cake, you will never want a regular sugar-and-fat-laden cake for your birthday again! 
  
To make the chocolate version, the bottom layer: 

Preheat the oven to 335. Put all the ingredients into a high speed blender and mix until smooth. Pour into a pan that is lightly greased with coconut oil. Add chocolate chips or nuts to the mixture if you wish. Bake for about 25 minutes. 

- 2-3 ripe bananas
- 1 cup of oats
- 3 scoops of chocolate whey protein powder
- 1 cup of plain Greek yogurt
- 1 egg 
- 1/2 an apple 
- 2-3 tbsp natural peanut butter
- 3 tbsp cocoa powder 
- 1 tbsp coconut oil
- 1-2 tsp stevia 
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 4 twists sea salt

Optional: chopped walnuts, chocolate chips, chia seeds, hemp seeds, poppy seeds   

To make the vanilla version, follow the same steps, except omit the cocoa powder, use vanilla protein powder instead of chocolate, and add a couple teaspoons of cinnamon. 

This recipe can be made into plenty of other flavours by playing around with the ingredients.
