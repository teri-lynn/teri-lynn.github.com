Pictured above is my healthy Banana Double Chocolate Cake layered with my Vanilla Cinnamon version. Between the layers is homemade peanut butter. All the ingredients are healthy, but after trying this cake, you will never want a regular sugar-and-fat-laden cake for your birthday again! 
  
To make the chocolate version, the bottom layer: 

Preheat the oven to 350. Put all the ingredients into a high speed blender and mix until smooth. Pour into a pan that is lightly greased with coconut oil. Add chocolate chips or nuts to the mixture if you wish. Bake for about 20-30 minutes. Bake longer if you want a firmer cake, and shorter for a creamier, softer cake. For a softer cake, take out it out of the oven when only the edges of the cake are starting to firm and crack, and the middle is still pudding-like. 

- 2-3 ripe bananas
- 1 cup of oats
- 3 scoops of [chocolate whey protein powder](http://halfwhey.com/)
- 1 cup of plain Greek yogurt
- 1 egg 
- 1/2 an apple 
- 2-3 tbsp natural peanut butter
- 1/4 cup cocoa powder 
- 1 tbsp coconut oil
- 1-2 tsp powdered stevia or 20-30 liquid stevia drops 
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 4 twists sea salt

Optional: chopped walnuts, chocolate chips, chia seeds, hemp seeds, poppy seeds. 

To make the vanilla version, follow the same steps, except omit the cocoa powder, use [vanilla whey protein powder](http://halfwhey.com/) instead of chocolate, and add a couple teaspoons of cinnamon. 

This recipe can be made into plenty of other flavours by playing around with the ingredients.
