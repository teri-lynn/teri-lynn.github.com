Here's different kind of "bread" made mostly with vegetables, egg whites, and protein powder. Not only is it full of flavour, but it's also packed with nutrients and protein. The addition of pumpkin seeds and parmesan cheese make this bread even more mouth-watering! 

You can play around with the spices and flavourings. I basically threw things into the blender when I made this, so it does not need to be exact measurements. Another tip is that if you slightly undercook the bread by taking it out of the oven too soon, it can be cooked more in the microwave. 

My inspiration for this recipe came from Anna Sward of Protein Pow and her [broccoli bread](http://proteinpow.com/2013/04/low-carb-gluten-free-broccoli-protein.html). 

Preheat the oven to 320 degrees and lightly grease a pie pan with olive oil. Throw all of these ingredients (except the parmesan cheese and pumpkin seeds) into a high speed blender and mix until smooth. Add in the cheese and seeds at the end and pulse a couple of times, or just leave them whole. Pour into a bread pan and bake for about an hour at 320 degrees. This bread will rise a couple centimetres, but not nearly as much as regular bread does, so you can fill the pan almost to the top. 

- 2 cups plain or unflavoured protein powder (4 scoops)
- 1 heaping cup oats
- 1 3/4 cup egg whites
- 1/4 cup Greek yogurt
- 2 cups steamed broccoli
- 1 cup baby carrots 
- 1.5 teaspoon baking powder 
- 1 tablespoon Italian spice
- 2 tablespoons minced garlic
- 4 twists sea salt
- 5 twists pepper
- 1/3 cup pumpkin seeds
- 1/2 cup parmesan petals

Store the bread in the fridge. 

The sandwich in the picture above has pesto, turkey, jalape√±o havardi cheese, tomato, avocado, and spinach.
