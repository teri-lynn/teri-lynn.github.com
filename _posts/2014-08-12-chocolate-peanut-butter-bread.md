Here is a delicious and decadent chocolate peanut butter bread - it's the chocolate version of my [Peanut Butter Loaf](http://teri-lynn.ca/2014/08/08/peanut-butter-loaf/). Enjoy this bread guilt-free as it is high in protein and contains no sugar or flour. It tastes great with any nut butter, topped with fruit, or with a healthy chocolate spread if you are feeling extra chocolatey! 

You can also try my recipe for [Vegetable Protein Bread](http://teri-lynn.ca/2014/08/01/vegetable-protein-bread/) which makes a great hearty sandwich. 

###Recipe

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees and lightly grease a loaf pan with coconut oil. Throw all of these ingredients into a high speed blender and mix until smooth. Mix in by hand additional ingredients such as nuts or chocolate chips if you wish. Pour into the pan and bake for about 45 minutes at 350 degrees. Leave a few centimetres at the top of the pan as this bread will rise, although not quite as much as regular bread. If you aren't sure if the bread is cooked, insert a knife which should come out almost clean. If you overcook, the bread can be too dry. Store the bread in the fridge.
