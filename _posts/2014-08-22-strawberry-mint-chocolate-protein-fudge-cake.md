Strawberries, mint, and chocolate - it's the perfect combination for an indulgent treat. You will feel like you are eating a fudge brownie, the only difference is that this protein cake is healthy! It's one of my many flavour combinations for my [Protein Cake](http://teri-lynn.ca/2014/04/13/protein-cake/) recipe. 
 
###Recipe

Preheat the oven to 350. Put all the ingredients (except the second cup of strawberries and the chocolate chips) into a high speed blender and mix until smooth. Pour almost all of the batter into a pan that is lightly greased with coconut oil. Leave a little batter in the blender to mix with the strawberries. Blend the strawberries until smooth, and then swirl this into the batter along with the chocolate chips. If you have fresh strawberries, you could also chop or slice them into the batter instead. Bake for about 30-35 minutes at 350 degrees, more or less, depending on how gooey you want the protein cake. If using the swirl method for the strawberries, you will need to cook the cake about 10 minutes longer than normal. A knife will come out slightly gooey when inserted into the cake, but it should be mostly clean. Store in the fridge.
