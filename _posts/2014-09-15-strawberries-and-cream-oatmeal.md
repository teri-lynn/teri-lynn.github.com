Here's a great oatmeal to try when you have some fresh strawberries on hand. You can make this recipe overnight or on the spot; both methods are delicious and quick. This oatmeal makes for a quick and easy healthy breakfast or snack. 

You can also try my [Cookies and Cream Tropical Oatmeal](http://teri-lynn.ca/2014/08/23/cookies-and-cream-tropical-oatmeal/) for another flavour. 

###Ingredients
Serves one.

- 1/3 cup oats
- 1/3 cup unsweetened almond milk
- 1 scoop Cookies N Cream protein powder (Muslce Pharm Combat)
- 2 tbsp plain Greek yogurt (a big spoonful) 
- 1 tbsp hemp seed hearts
- 4-5 strawberries, sliced 
- 1 tbsp chocolate chips
- stevia to taste

###Overnight Method 
Stir together all of the ingredients except the strawberries and chocolate chips. Put this mixture in a covered container in the fridge overnight. Stir again the next day and put in the microwave for about a minute. Then add the strawberries and chocolate chips. 

###Microwave Method

Put the almond milk and oats into a bowl and heat in the microwave until the oatmeal is cooked to your preference. Then stir in the protein powder, followed by the rest of the ingredients. You may want to use a little less milk since it won't absorb quite as much as it does overnight, although this depends on how runny/thick you like your oatmeal.
