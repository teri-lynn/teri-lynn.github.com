Intervals consist of high intensity work periods combined with low intensity or 
rest periods. They are a great way for athletes to increase their aerobic 
capacity and lactate threshold, and also help to burn body fat more effectively 
by boosting your metabolism. There are many types of interval training, with a 
few shown below. The time spent doing an interval session can range, but an 
effective interval workout can be done in less than 20 minutes!

### Standard Intervals

- Decide on a work to rest ratio
- For example, a ratio of 1:1 would be equal times of work and rest
- Choose a time for each work period
- For example, 30 seconds of work at 1:3 would be 30 seconds hard, 90 seconds 
  recovery
- Repeat the intervals as many times as you would like (5 to 10 is good)
- Be sure to do a few minutes of warm up and cool down
- Types of exercise: any cardio equipment, sprints, body weight exercise

### High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)

- Short and intense set of intervals
- Original protocol is 2:1 ratio of work to recovery
- 6-10 repetitions where work ratio is at maximum intensity and recovery ratio 
  is at 50% of maximum heart rate
- Entire session should last around 15-20 minutes
- Types of exercise: any

### Tabata Intervals

- 20 seconds at maximum intensity, followed by 10 seconds of rest (2:1 ratio)
- Repeat 8 times
- Type of HIIT 
- Types of exercise: sprints, biking, body weight exercises

### Fartlek Training

- Means *speed play* in Swedish
- Originally developed for cross-country running as a way to train for both 
  speed and endurance 
- Less structured than traditional intervals
- Intensity and speed varies throughout session (athlete changes it when 
  he/she wishes)
- Sessions should be designed for the athleteâ€™s specific sport, ranging 
  between 60 and 80% of maximum heart rate
- Types of exercise: any

### Pyramid Intervals

- Increase each work interval, while keeping the rest period the same, then go 
  back down again
- For example:
  - 30 seconds work, 1 minute rest
  - 45 seconds work, 1 minute rest
  - 60 seconds work, 1 minute rest
  - 90 seconds work, 1 minute rest
  - 60 seconds work, 1 minute rest
  - 45 seconds work, 1 minute rest
  - 30 seconds work, 1 minute rest
- Types of exercise: any
