Here's a healthy flavour twist on regular banana bread. I used my original [Protein Cake](http://teri-lynn.ca/2014/04/13/protein-cake/) recipe as a base to come up with this delicious variation. The result was this protein-packed peanut butter infused banana bread-like-cake. It's addicting! 

### Recipe
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Put all the ingredients into a high speed blender and mix until smooth. Pour into a pan that is lightly greased with coconut oil. Add chocolate chips to the mixture if you wish. Bake for about 20-25 minutes. Bake longer if you want a firmer bread/cake, and shorter for a creamier, softer cake. For a softer cake, take out it out of the oven when only the edges of the cake are starting to firm and crack, and the middle is still pudding-like.

Store in the fridge. 

You can make this recipe into muffins, squares, a loaf, or make it into a layered cake. Stay tuned for the optional healthy peanut butter icing recipe to come!
