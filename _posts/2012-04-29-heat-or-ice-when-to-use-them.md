title: Heat or Ice? When to use them.
---

Heat and ice are used for different kinds of injuries: *Acute* pain/injuries 
happen suddenly due to some type of trauma such as a fall or collision. 
Symptoms of an acute injury include pain, tenderness, redness, warm skin, 
swelling, and inflammation. *Chronic* pain/injuries are slower to develop 
and could come and go, causing dull pain or aches. They could be due to an 
overuse injury, or an acute injury that was not treated properly and did not 
heal. Once you have determined your type of injury, use these guidelines:

## Ice:

  - Use immediately for acute injuries to reduce swelling and pain
  - Use for chronic injuries after exercise to reduce pain and reduce/prevent 
    inflammation
  - Use in 10 minute increments, only applying again once skin temperature is 
    back to normal
  - Use an ice pack, a bag of frozen peas, or freeze water in a Styrofoam cup 
    to use as an ice massager
  - Put a thin layer of material between skin and ice

## Heat:

  - Use for chronic injuries that have no inflammation or swelling
  - Muscles that are sore and tight will benefit from increased circulation 
    due to heat application, helping them to relax 
  - Can be used before exercise to stimulate blood flow and increase joint 
    and tissue elasticity
  - Use in 15-20 minute increments, making sure you have layers between the 
    skin and heat 
  - Moist heat is the most effective (such as an Epson salt bath, a hot towel, 
    or a special heating pad)
