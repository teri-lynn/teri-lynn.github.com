Almost everyone could use some improvement in their posture. Poor posture can 
arise from sitting for long periods at a desk, or working the chest too much 
in comparison to your back. Proper posture will keep your back safe from 
injury. When the spine is compressed from not keeping your back tall, it causes 
tension in your back muscles and puts your spine out of alignment. This can 
lead to many health issues.

Here are some general suggestions to help improve your posture:

- Sit and stand tall all throughout your day. Your shoulders should be back, 
  and your head should be in line with your spine. 
- When you workout, always do at least 2 back exercises for every chest 
  exercise. Some people may need to do even more back exercises in comparison 
  to chest exercises. Strong back muscles help pull the shoulders back so that 
  they are not rounded forward.
- Stretch your chest out. Look under *stretch* on 
  [this link](http://www.exrx.net/Lists/ExList/ChestWt.html) for chest 
  stretches you can try. Note that the doorway stretch can also be done with 
  both arms at the same time, or on a stability ball.
