# Testimonials

*Jenn W says...*

> Teri-Lynn was an informative and fun personal trainer. Not only did she show 
me how to do the exercises, she motivated me and helped me understand why I was 
doing each exercise. I learned a ton from Teri-Lynn and anyone who trains with 
her will agree she knows her stuff!


*Maureen B says...*

> I started training with Teri-Lynn in November 2010 when I was 17 years old 
with my main goals of losing weight and learning the proper way to work out. It 
was difficult and intimidating at first but Teri-Lynn helped me to slowly learn 
how to use my body and live a healthy life style. She is someone that you 
instantly can't help but love, her kindness and friendly manner doesn't stop 
her from pushing you to be the best person you can be. It is now a year and a 
few months later and I now consider Teri-Lynn a dear friend of mine and I 
continue to train with her. I've lost 48 pounds, almost 15% of my body fat and 
I've become faster and stronger then I ever imagined. She pushes me in every 
workout and makes me push myself as well. I couldn't imagine a better woman and 
trainer. She is an all around amazing person who has so much to offer. I would 
recommend her to absolutely anyone. I've watched her work with people younger 
and older then her and she's great with both. I wouldn't be anywhere close to 
where I am now without everything she's done for me and I know that we will 
have a lifetime of friendship.


*Sue W says...*

> I have been very happy to have Teri-Lynn as my personal trainer. I do not 
always look forward to going to the gym, but after my workout with her I do 
feel good and am glad I came. She pushes me to my limit, but always makes the 
workouts fun and switches things around so you are never bored. You really 
don't know what she's going to throw your way. I have trouble with my knee and 
my Dr. thought I might need surgery, but since working out with Teri-Lynn my 
knee has improved and I do not have need of surgery. Thanks Teri-Lynn!


*Joan C says...*

> I've trained with Teri-Lynn on a few occasions. I found her to be 
professional in every way. She is motivating and encouraging yet always pushes 
you to perform at your optimal level for best results. She is friendly and 
approachable and I can't wait until my next opportunity to work with her.


*Behnaz M says...*

> I really enjoyed training with Teri-Lynn, because she was very motivating and 
she challenged me to push myself to the next level. She even did the workouts 
with me on a number of occasions. With Teri-Lynn's help, I became very strong, 
built muscle, lost 11 pounds (from 140 lb to 129 lb) and dropped 2 dress sizes 
within 6 months! Thanks Teri-Lynn for all your help and support!


*Barb S says...*

> I had an amazing experience with Teri-Lynn, and would highly recommend her as 
a trainer. Her best attribute was her ability to listen to my needs, and then 
cater her instructions and routine so that I would not just push a bit harder 
but would be comfortable with the exercises. She has a huge inventory of ways 
to accomplish to accomplish something, and doesn't believe that pain is the 
answer. She is also an extremely nice, genuine and sincere individual - it was 
actually fun going to Personal Training with her.


*Maureen J says...*

> I have trained with Teri-Lynn with another small group of women for about 
2 years now. Teri-Lynn is always making the workouts challenging yet fun and I 
know that after my workout regardless how hard it can be at times I will feel 
better and be glad that I did it. The other girls in the class are wonderful 
and we are now friends as well as workout partners thanks to Teri-Lynn. Even 
when I am not training with Teri-Lynn now she is always there with some advice 
or motivation if needed. Thank you Teri-Lynn.


*Barbara B says...*

> I took a group session for a year with Teri-Lynn. The group consisted of 5 
women whose ages ranged from early 40's to late sixties. It was wonderful how 
she had the ability to tailor a program that was beneficial to each of us. She 
has a great sense of humour, communication skills, and patience making us all 
feel very comfortable. She was able to explain in detail the benefits of the 
various exercises to specific parts of the body. She certainly pushed me to a 
level of fitness that I would not have been able to achieve otherwise.


*Barbara V says...*

> I participated in two programs that Teri-Lynn ran - Learn to Run and Circuit 
Training. As a trainer, Teri-Lynn is very knowledgeable and passionate about 
fitness. When she was training me, she was very supportive and gave the right 
amount of encouragement so I would not give up. I enjoyed the time I spent with 
Teri-Lynn and have continued using the techniques/exercises she had taught me.


*Karen W says...*

> Teri-Lynn is a fantastic, motivational personal trainer! She has excellent 
experience and a variety of interests in areas such as exercise, nutrition, 
and life skills. She has developed a personalized program specific to my needs, 
age, and activity level. I’ve increased my stamina and muscle tone and have 
been given great support with nutrition. I also enjoy that Teri-Lynn changes 
the training program on a regular basis to keep things interesting. Life has 
changed in a positive way since training with Teri-Lynn.


*Lynne P says...*

> I have been to several gyms in the last 10 years with no success. Now that
I have Teri-Lynn as a trainer,  I have seen great results in the last 6 months. 
She has the unique ability and training skills that allow me to train correctly 
and give me the best results in a shorter period of time. Her knowledge of 
nutrition and health has also contributed to my results. I am truly thankful 
for all that she has done and I will continue to train with her.


*Angela B says...*

> I had wonderful experience training with Teri-Lynn in a group setting. With 
her guidance and friendly personality, we were able to mesh perfectly as a group. 
Through her motivation I was able to achieve my goal. Teri-Lynn offers experience, 
education and professionalism – she was always able to keep us on track and push 
us to our unique potential. Teri-Lynn has passed on her passion for fitness to me 
which gives me the enthusiasm needed to maintain my goal by attending the gym 
regularly with the same group. Thank you Teri-Lynn.


*Nancy L says...*

> I have trained with Teri-Lynn in a small group of women on a couple of occasions.
Teri-Lynn is always challenging you to do better which is great because you usually 
want to give up. She pushes you to your limit which in the end, the results are 
great. You always feel great after one of Teri-Lynn's workouts. She is very positive, 
friendly and professional. Teri-Lynn is always making the workouts challenging yet fun. 
When we were finished with our classes Teri-Lynn helped me put together some workouts 
for the ladies and myself. She is always ready to answer any question or give you advice.
Thanks Teri-Lynn for all your help and support. 


*Agnes N says...*

> Teri-Lynn is an enthusiastic and knowledgeable personal trainer. She made it fun and 
always knew how to challenge me to get that extra effort. She is very knowledgeable about 
a variety of topics including nutrition and if she doesn’t know the answer to a question 
always follows up. A great motivator!

*David Y says...*

> Attending Teri-Lynn's fitness programs has been excellent in changing my lifestyle to a more fitness oriented one. As the mix of exercises are well thought out, she also lets you know the proper form and the benefits. I look forward to attending the classes as they are tough and enjoyable, which helps me get going for the rest of the week. Thanks again Teri-Lynn.

*Emily D says...*

> With knowledge, passion and dedication, Teri-Lynn Nelson went beyond my expectations of personal training. In May 2013, I started doing Teri-Lynn’s outdoor group workouts. As a fitness enthusiast already, I didn’t join for motivation to keep fit. I joined to enhance my knowledge of form, muscle development and to learn new exercises. Now, Teri-Lynn is my personal trainer. I am blessed to have her coach my fitness journey. 

> Teri-Lynn is THE expert on form and posture. She is dedicated at making sure I perform exercises perfectly so that I don’t injure myself. Since working with Teri-Lynn, my overall strength and performance has increased because of improved form and posture. 

> When I started working out with Teri-Lynn, I had a back injury. Teri-Lynn taught me that if one side of your body is too heavy, it will ruin your posture and harm your form. All of Teri-Lynn’s routines work the full body. With Teri-Lynn’s knowledge and help, I have learned exercises that increased my back’s strength as well as my entire body. This has reduced my back pain immensely. 

> I love learning new routines and exercises. With Teri-Lynn, it never gets boring. From outdoor workouts to weights to bands, I have something new and challenging to look forward to. And the results really show! 

> Working out with Teri-Lynn is a rewarding experience and investment. It’s rare to find a trainer that has as much knowledge, passion and dedication as her. She has the loveliest disposition, but knows when to push you harder. It’s the perfect balance. Highly recommend her!
