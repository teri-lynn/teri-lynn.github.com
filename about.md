# About

## Biography

I achieved bachelor degrees in Physical Education (Honours) and Education upon 
completion of the Concurrent Physical Education program at Brock University in 
June, 2010, classifying me as an Ontario Certified Teacher. I competed as a 
varsity cross country athlete at Brock while also participating in figure 
skating, soccer, golf, skiing, hockey, tennis, and rollerblading.

I have been a Personal Training Specialist and GoodLife Personal Trainer since 
August, 2010. Since then, I have trained women varying in age, goals, and 
experience. I have helped my clients overcome injuries and health issues, as 
well as reach their fitness goals. I have conducted a variety of group training 
programs.

I continue to grow as a trainer by researching, taking courses, and adding to 
my certifications so that I can offer the best possible experience. Sports and 
fitness have always been my passion, and I love to teach and motivate others. 
My hope is to pass on my success, enthusiasm, positive attitude, and love for 
fitness to my clients, and be a part of their success!
