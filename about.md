<h2>Biography</h2>

<p>I achieved bachelor degrees in Physical Education (Honours) and Education upon 
completion of the Concurrent Physical Education program at Brock University in 
June, 2010, classifying me as an Ontario Certified Teacher. I competed as a 
varsity cross country athlete at Brock while also participating in figure 
skating, soccer, golf, skiing, hockey, tennis, and rollerblading.</p>

<p>I have been a Personal Training Specialist since August, 2010. Since then, 
I have trained people varying in age, goals, and experience. I have helped 
my clients overcome injuries and health issues, as well as reach their fitness 
goals. I have conducted a variety of group training programs.</p>

<p>I continue to grow as a trainer by researching, taking courses, and adding to 
my certifications so that I can offer the best possible experience. Sports and 
fitness have always been my passion, and I love to teach and motivate others. 
My hope is to pass on my success, enthusiasm, positive attitude, and love for 
fitness to my clients, and be a part of their success!</p>

<p>I currently work as a Personal Trainer for 
[Precision Athletics](http://www.precisionathletics.ca/) in Vancouver, 
British Columbia. Please see their website for more information on how you
can train with me.<p>
