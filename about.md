# Teaching

I graduated from Brock University with a Bachelors of Physical Education 
(Honours) and a Bachelor of Education. I am qualified to teach Health and 
Physical Education and Geography at the Intermediate and Senior levels. 
While at Brock I also competed on the cross country team.

# Training

I am currently working at the Aurora Women's GoodLife as a Level 2 Personal 
Training Specialist. Sports and fitness have always been my passion, so helping 
people reach their goals is a very rewarding career for me. I am always looking 
to gain new clients and work with them toward their health and fitness 
solutions. Contact me for information on how I can help you become successful!
